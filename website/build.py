"""Builds the smartgurukul.org marketing site into ../docs (served by GitHub Pages from main:/docs).

Each file in pages/ starts with a JSON meta block in an HTML comment, followed by the page body:

    <!--meta {"path": "ai-for-schools.html", "title": "...", "description": "...", ...} -->
    <section>...</section>

This script wraps every body in the shared <head> (title, description, canonical, Open Graph,
hreflang, JSON-LD), header and footer, then writes sitemap.xml, llms.txt and the redirect stubs, and
checks the result. Run it after editing anything here:

    python website/build.py        (no third-party dependencies; exits 1 when a check FAILs)

Meta keys:
- path, title, description: required.
- crumb: the breadcrumb name (every page except the home pages and 404).
- lang: "hi" for Hindi pages. alternate: the other-language version of this page.
  hreflang: [en_path, hi_path] for a page that has a Hindi pair (written to the head and sitemap).
- og_title, og_image_alt: social-card overrides.
- has_form: the page holds the demo form. cta_href / cta_label: header button override.
- noindex: keep out of search, the sitemap and llms.txt.
- software: false drops the SoftwareApplication node (privacy, 404, share).
- service: true adds the Service node (website-services). llms: "optional" lists the page under
  "## Optional" in llms.txt. priority: the sitemap priority.

Every indexable product page (software pages without a form) gets the "Try it free for a month" demo
band before the footer, unless its body already has a .cta-band. On Hindi pages, links to English
pages get hreflang="en".

Pages in docs/ that are NOT built here: deck.html (build_deck.py), film.html, onboarding-toolkit.html
(hand-written), robots.txt, site.webmanifest, CNAME, favicon.ico, the IndexNow key file and assets/.

LLMS_FACTS = """# Smart Gurukul

> Smart Gurukul (smartgurukul.org) is a school management app for Indian K-12 schools, made in India by an IIT-BHU team. Tagline: "Your whole school, connected." (Hindi: "पूरा स्कूल, एक ऐप पर जुड़ा।"). One app for principals, teachers, students and parents, in English and Hindi, combining school operations, AI tools and game-based learning. Smart Gurukul is a software company, not a school.

Key facts:
- Brand: Smart Gurukul (स्मार्ट गुरुकुल). Website: https://smartgurukul.org. Contact: the demo request form at https://smartgurukul.org/#demo. Instagram: @smartgurukul.app.
- Who it is for: private CBSE and State Board schools in India of any size. Each school, or each branch of a group, runs as its own account.
- Attendance: class teachers mark student attendance (present, absent, late, half-day); parents with a parent account get an alert when their child is marked absent. Teachers check in by GPS from their own phone; the distance to the school's saved location is checked on the server (100 m radius by default, up to 700 m), and check-ins from phones with a fake-GPS app, Developer options, root/jailbreak or a cloner app are refused. No biometric hardware is needed.
- Timetable: bell schedule (including Saturday), weekly timetables with rooms, one-period date changes (substitute, cancel, extra period), a list of periods that need a substitute based on staff attendance, free teachers per period, and notifications to the affected teachers and students. Admins can make changes by chatting with the AI helpdesk and confirming them. There is no automatic timetable generation.
- Fees: admin-set fee structures per class, bills for a whole section, due dates, concessions, waivers, late fees and corrections, payments recorded by the school (cash, cheque, UPI or bank-transfer reference) with numbered PDF receipts, reversals for mistakes, bounced cheques and refunds, and fee-due reminders to parents. Online fee payment is not available.
- Payroll and expenses: salary structures, monthly payroll runs and payslips in the app (no PF/ESI/TDS); vendors and expenses with approvals (no self-approval); one ledger with a day book and fund summary.
- Exams and report cards: the school's own grading scale and terms, marks entered by each class's teachers, report cards published to a section, PDF report cards, and alerts to students and parents on publish.
- School bus: the driver's phone shares the bus location during a trip (no GPS device); the driver marks boarding and drop-off; families get app and WhatsApp alerts and see the bus live while their child is on it. No route planning.
- Parents: the same app. They see attendance, fees and receipts with fee-due reminders, report card, timetable, upcoming tests, ID card and the school bus. Two ways to sign in, both tied to the mobile number on the child's record: a one-time code on WhatsApp signs in on the child's own account (switching between all children on that number), or a parent account (the child's registration number and that number, then a username and password once the school approves it). A parent account adds absence alerts, school announcements and chat with the child's teachers and the school office.
- AI: an AI helpdesk assistant (users ask about their own attendance, fees and timetable; admins also about school-wide figures, through a fixed set of checked, school-scoped lookups rather than free-form database queries); Academic Helper (students are taught the method rather than given answers); and an AI question paper generator for teachers (up to 30 questions, MCQ, true/false, one-word, numeric, short and long answer; shared as a PDF with or without the answer key; MCQs can go to the quiz bank). AI output is a draft for teachers to check.
- Games: one XP score from attendance, assessment results, quiz wins and teacher-awarded participation; streaks, weekly leagues (Bronze up to Gurukul Master), House Wars, live Battle Room quizzes and 1v1 Gurukul Arena. Quiz questions are written by teachers or drafted with AI and reviewed by teachers.
- Also included: chat and announcements, school events with RSVP, admissions tracked by stage, student and staff ID cards with a QR code, attendance export, activity log.
- Languages: the app works in English and Hindi.
- Getting started: free 1-month pilot. The Smart Gurukul team imports the school's student register and trains staff. Pricing is shared after a demo.
- Not available: online fee payment, homework, SMS, hostel, library, statutory payroll (PF/ESI/TDS), full accounting (trial balance, balance sheet), automatic timetable generation, bus route planning."""
